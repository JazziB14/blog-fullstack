Attached with the following: 
-Screenshot 20240924 141319.png: a screenshot of the frontend of my application
-Screenshot 20240924 141245.png: the JS of my application with one of the function and my comments of what I plan to do

Goal: when a user submits the posts it submits to supabase

Imagine you're a senior developer walking a beginner developer how to approach this problem.

Given this, walk me through this code & implementation step-by-step assuming I don't have prior context.

Here's the steps to follow:
- First review the screenshots close
- Understand all the concepts required 
- Assume I'm a beginner in the language 
- Include an additional resource(s) that will aid my understanding
- You write in markdown
